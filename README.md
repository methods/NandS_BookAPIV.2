## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

*   **Python 3**: Version 3.7 or newer is recommended. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
*   **pip**: Python's package installer. It usually comes with Python installations.
*   **make**: A build automation tool. Pre-installed on macOS/Linux. Windows users may need to install it (e.g., via Chocolatey or WSL).
* [Docker](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/docker)
* [Colima](https://github.com/abiosoft/colima) (for Mac/Linux users)
* [mongosh](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/shell) (MongoDB shell client)
* *(Optional)* [MongoDB Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/compass) (GUI client)

## Getting Started

This project uses a `Makefile` to automate setup and common tasks.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:methods/NandS_BookAPIV.2.git
    cd NandS_BookAPIV.2
    ```

2.  **View available commands:**
    To see a list of all available commands, run:
    ```bash
    make help
    ```

## MongoDB Setup with Docker and Colima

This project requires MongoDB to be running locally. We recommend using **Docker** and **Colima** for a lightweight, consistent environment.

### Step 1: Start Colima

```bash
colima start
```

### Step 2: Pull the MongoDB Docker Image

```bash
docker pull mongodb/mongodb-community-server:latest
```
### Step 3: Run the MongoDB Container

```bash
docker run --name mongodb \
  -p 27017:27017 \
  -d mongodb/mongodb-community-server:latest
```

### Step 4: Verify MongoDB is Running

```
docker container ls
```
Look for a container named `mongodb` with port `27017` exposed.

### Step 5: Connect via `mongosh`

```
mongosh
```
This opens an interactive shell. You should see a connection string like:
```
mongodb://localhost:27017
```

### Step 6 (Optional): Use MongoDB Compass GUI

Open [MongoDB Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/compass)

Paste the connection string from `mongosh`:
`mongodb://localhost:27017`

Use Compass to explore, import JSON/CSV data, and manage your database visually.

## Common Commands

The `Makefile` will automatically create a virtual environment (`venv`) and install dependencies the first time you run a command.

## How to Run the API

To run the Flask application in debug mode:
```bash
make run
```
The API will be available at http://127.0.0.1:5000.

## How to Run Linting
This project uses **Pylint** to check code quality and style.

To run the linter, run the following command:

```bash
make lint
```


## How to Run Tests and Check Coverage
This project uses **coverage.py** to measure code coverage.

To run the test suite and see the coverage report:
```bash
make test
```

If old data is persisting, you can use an explicit
```bash
coverage erase
```
command to clean out the old data.

## Clean the Project

To remove the virtual environment and Python cache files:
```bash
make clean
```
This is useful if you want to start with a fresh environment.
